# SeedData
Queries used in the [Seed Data](https://medium.com/seed-data) Medium blog.

Uses Jeff Sackmann's tennis datasets, most prominently the [`tennis_atp`](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp) repo. If you'd like to set it up for yourself, [my fork of the repo](https://github.com/harman28/tennis_atp) has some useful scripts to help you get started.

## License
I considered making this completely unlicensed, since it's just a collection of SQL queries, so what's there to license? Using MIT anyway, because if any of my results (or the methodology used to obtain these results) are ever reused in ualtered form, then I'd love to have attribution. I don't expect it, but I'd love it.
